By 2050 this proportion will be 70%. Urbanization is associated with increased levels of mental illness, but it’s not yet clear why. Through a controlled experiment, we investigated whether nature experience would influence rumination (repetitive thought focused on negative aspects of the self), a known risk factor for mental illness. Participants who went on a 90-min walk through a natural environment reported lower levels of rumination and showed reduced neural activity in an area of the brain linked to risk for mental illness compared with those who walked through an urban environment. These results suggest that accessible natural areas may be vital for mental health in our rapidly urbanizing world.\n          , \n            Urbanization has many benefits, but it also is associated with increased levels of mental illness, including depression. It has been suggested that decreased nature experience may help to explain the link between urbanization and mental illness. This suggestion is supported by a growing body of correlational and experimental evidence, which raises a further question: what mechanism(s) link decreased nature experience to the development of mental illness? One such mechanism might be the impact of nature exposure on rumination, a maladaptive pattern of self-referential thought that is associated with heightened risk for depression and other mental illnesses. We show in healthy participants that a brief nature experience, a 90-min walk in a natural setting, decreases both self-reported rumination and neural activity in the subgenual prefrontal cortex (sgPFC), whereas a 90-min walk in an urban setting has no such effects on self-reported rumination or neural activity. In other studies, the sgPFC has been associated with a self-focused behavioral withdrawal linked to rumination in both depressed and healthy individuals. This study reveals a pathway by which nature experience may improve mental well-being and suggests that accessible natural areas within urban contexts may be a critical resource for mental health in our rapidly urbanizing world.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Bratman","given":"Gregory N."},{"family":"Hamilton","given":"J.

Rates of depression, anxiety, self-harm, and suicide rose sharply, more than doubling on most measures. Why? In The Anxious Generation, social psychologist Jonathan Haidt lays out the facts about the epidemic of teen mental illness that hit many countries at the same time. He then investigates the nature of childhood, including why children need play and independent exploration to mature into competent, thriving adults. Haidt shows how the \"play-based childhood\" began to decline in the 1980s, and how it was finally wiped out by the arrival of the \"phone-based childhood\" in the early 2010s. He presents more than a dozen mechanisms by which this \"great rewiring of childhood\" has interfered with children's social and neurological development, covering everything from sleep deprivation to attention fragmentation, addiction, loneliness, social contagion, social comparison, and perfectionism. He explains why social media damages girls more than boys and why boys have been withdrawing from the real world into the virtual world, with disastrous consequences for themselves, their families, and their societies. Most important, Haidt issues a clear call to action. He diagnoses the \"collective action problems\" that trap us, and then proposes four simple rules that might set us free. He describes steps that parents, teachers, schools, tech companies, and governments can take to end the epidemic of mental illness and restore a more humane childhood. Haidt has spent his career speaking truth backed by data in the most difficult landscapes-communities polarized by politics and religion, campuses battling culture wars, and now the public health emergency faced by Gen Z.

In the presence of other bystanders, personal distress is enhanced, and fixed action patterns of avoidance and freezing dominate. This new perspective suggests that bystander apathy results from a reflexive emotional reaction dependent on the personality of the bystander.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Hortensius","given":"Ruud"},{"family":"De Gelder","given":"Beatrice"}],"citation-key":"hortensiusEmpathyApathyBystander2018","container-title":"Current Directions in Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Curr Dir Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0963721417749653","ISSN":"0963-7214, 1467-8721","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",8]]},"language":"en","page":"249-256","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"From Empathy to Apathy: The Bystander Effect Revisited","title-short":"From Empathy to Apathy","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963721417749653","volume":"27"},{"id":"houselPsychologyMoneyTimeless2020","author":[{"family":"Housel","given":"Morgan"}],"citation-key":"houselPsychologyMoneyTimeless2020","event-place":"Petersfield","ISBN":"978-0-85719-768-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"eng","number-of-pages":"242","publisher":"Harriman House","publisher-place":"Petersfield","source":"K10plus ISBN","title":"The psychology of money: timeless lessons on wealth, greed, and happiness","title-short":"The psychology of money","type":"book"},{"id":"jamesPrinciplesPsychologyTwo1995","author":[{"family":"James","given":"William"}],"citation-key":"jamesPrinciplesPsychologyTwo1995","collection-title":"Dover-books on biology, psychology and medicine","edition":"Facsim. of ed.

It argues against the popular view that self-control depends on a limited physiological resource (blood glucose) that is depleted by even brief acts of self-control and is restored by glucose consumption. Instead, the results highlight the critical role of beliefs about willpower in self-control performance.\n          , \n            Past research found that the ingestion of glucose can enhance self-control. It has been widely assumed that basic physiological processes underlie this effect. We hypothesized that the effect of glucose also depends on people’s theories about willpower. Three experiments, both measuring (experiment 1) and manipulating (experiments 2 and 3) theories about willpower, showed that, following a demanding task, only people who view willpower as limited and easily depleted (a limited resource theory) exhibited improved self-control after sugar consumption. In contrast, people who view willpower as plentiful (a nonlimited resource theory) showed no benefits from glucose—they exhibited high levels of self-control performance with or without sugar boosts. Additionally, creating beliefs about glucose ingestion (experiment 3) did not have the same effect as ingesting glucose for those with a limited resource theory. We suggest that the belief that willpower is limited sensitizes people to cues about their available resources including physiological cues, making them dependent on glucose boosts for high self-control performance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Job","given":"Veronika"},{"family":"Walton","given":"Gregory M."},{"family":"Bernecker","given":"Katharina"},{"family":"Dweck","given":"Carol S."}],"citation-key":"jobBeliefsWillpowerDetermine2013","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

Study 2 replicated the effect, manipulating lay theories about willpower. Study 3 addressed questions about the mechanism underlying the effect. Study 4, a longitudinal field study, found that theories about willpower predict change in eating behavior, procrastination, and self-regulated goal striving in depleting circumstances.

We demonstrate that people systematically misunderstand their own creativity across an ideation session. Eight studies found that people expect their creativity to decline across an ideation session when it, in fact, tends to improve or persist (we call this misprediction the creative cliff illusion). These beliefs are consequential because they lead people to undervalue ideation: They exhibit less task persistence and lower creative performance. This research documents a fundamental disconnect between people’s beliefs and the reality of how creativity emerges over time. It demonstrates the value of understanding creativity beliefs and has implications for facilitating creativity in individuals and their organizations and institutions.\n          , \n            Across eight studies, we tested whether people understand the time course of their own creativity. Prior literature finds that creativity tends to improve across an ideation session. Here we compared people’s beliefs against their actual creative performance. Consistent with prior research, we found that people’s creativity, on aggregate, remained constant or improved across an ideation session. However, people’s beliefs did not match this reality. We consistently found that people expected their creativity to decline over time. We refer to this misprediction as the creative cliff illusion. Study 1 found initial evidence of this effect across an ideation task. We found further evidence in a sample with high domain-relevant knowledge (study 2), when creativity judgments were elicited retrospectively (study 3), and across a multiday study (study 5). We theorized the effect occurs because people mistakenly associate creativity (the novelty and usefulness of an idea) with idea production (the ability to generate an idea). Study 4 found evidence consistent with this mechanism. The creative cliff illusion was attenuated among those with high levels of everyday creative experience (study 6) and after a knowledge intervention that increased awareness of the effect (study 7). Demonstrating the impact of creativity beliefs on downstream performance, study 8 found that declining creativity beliefs negatively influenced task persistence and creative performance, suggesting that people underinvest in ideation. This research contributes to work on prediction in the creative domain and demonstrates the importance of understanding creativity beliefs for predicting creative performance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Lucas","given":"Brian J."},{"family":"Nordgren","given":"Loran F."}],"citation-key":"lucasCreativeCliffIllusion2020","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

(TRF) improves metabolic health. Both early TRF (eTRF, food intake restricted to the early part of the day) and mid-day TRF (mTRF, food intake restricted to the middle of the day) have been shown to have metabolic benefits. However, the two regimens have yet to be thoroughly compared. We conducted a five-week randomized trial to compare the effects of the two TRF regimens in healthy individuals without obesity (ChiCTR2000029797). The trial has completed. Ninety participants were randomized to eTRF (n=30), mTRF (n=30), or control groups (n=30) using a computer-based random-number generator. Eighty-two participants completed the entire five-week trial and were analyzed (28 in eTRF, 26 in mTRF, 28 in control groups). The primary outcome was the change in insulin resistance. Researchers who assessed the outcomes were blinded to group assignment, but participants and care givers were not. Here we show that eTRF was more effective than mTRF at improving insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, eTRF, but not mTRF, improved fasting glucose, reduced total body mass and adiposity, ameliorated inflammation, and increased gut microbial diversity. No serious adverse events were reported during the trial. In conclusion, eTRF showed greater benefits for insulin resistance and related metabolic parameters compared with mTRF.
